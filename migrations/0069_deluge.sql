-- Deluge: the first label-isolated torrent client. Beyond its own registry row, this migration
-- replaces the scope shape/option triggers once for the whole label family (deluge, rtorrent,
-- utorrent, flood, aria2, downloadstation) so the later family members only add a registry row.
-- A family scope is a lowercase label (the strictest rule any member's label store accepts), a
-- queue placement (recent/older: 0 last, 1 first) and an add-paused flag in initial_state
-- (started|stopped). provider_scopes is not rebuilt.
