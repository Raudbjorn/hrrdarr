-- NZBGet: a second usenet download client. One registry row plus replacement scope shape/option
-- triggers, as anticipated by 0059 and done for Transmission in 0062. provider_scopes is not
-- rebuilt: an NZBGet domain is its category, a job priority (NZBGet's own integer scale) and
-- an add-paused flag stored in initial_state (started|stopped). The provider_scopes CHECK on the
-- priority columns (-100..2) predates NZBGet and cannot be altered without rebuilding the table, so
-- NZBGet priorities are stored as codes, not wire values: very_low -100, low -1, normal 0, high 1,
-- very_high 2, force -2. The application maps codes to NZBGet's -100/-50/0/50/100/900.
